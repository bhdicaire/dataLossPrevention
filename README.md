You’ve been there too — setting up a data loss prevention solution might be a damn long project (DLP), if you need to _support multiple languages_ and don’t have [adequate data sources](dataSets/source.md).

This repository consolidate Data Loss/Leak Prevention insight and [sample files (e.g., datasets)](dataSets/README.md), that I have collected and used over the years. Your quality assurance library does not have to be unique, everyone strives for consistency. 

Fork this repository, and improve _your_ library. Even better, send me an update :laughing:.

> **A DLP solution is a set of enterprise processes, [tools, and techniques](techniques/README.md) that monitor sensitive information and prevent data exfiltration.**

## What problem does it solve and why is it useful?

I wasn't happy with the provided bundle of mock files to test my DLP policies and [demonstrate compliance](techniques/compliance.md). They were either [too simple or not localized for my use case](dataSets/README.md).

Friend don’t let friends test the effectiveness of a DLP solution with production data. You need _realistic test data[^1]_ in several formats such as CSV, JSON, SQL, TXT, and Excel to make sure your DLP Policies are working correctly especially after a significant change.
